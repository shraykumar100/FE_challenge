# Front-end Coding Challenge

## Idea of the App 
The task is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
There will also be a simple drill down feature that displays a time series graph of various metrics for the given repository.
You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API (Github API explained down below). 

## Features
* As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month. 
* As a User I should be able to identify period of time to search for most starred repos.
* As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row. 
* As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :
  * Repository name
  * Repository description 
  * Number of stars for the repo. 
  * Number of issues for the repo.
  * Username and avatar of the owner. 
* As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).
* As a User I should be able to drill down into each repo and see the commit activity a weekly basis for up to a year of the most recent history of the repo
  * Dropdown option allows for selection for showing additions or deletions vor commits (generally "changes"), which applies to both plots
  * One graph for total number of changes across all contributors per week
    * On hover we should see the exact number of changes, along with the human readable timestamp
  * One graph with a multiline plot, one line for each contributor's total changes per week
    * On hover we see the exact number of changes, along with the human readable timestamp, contributor
    * A different line on the graph should be shown per contributor
    * A legend that allows toggle per contributor
  * Both plots share the same x axis but are separate vertically stacked plots.
  * Need human readable x axis labels for weeks by start dates, y axis for counts

## Things to keep in mind ðŸš¨
Your code will be evaluated on:
- whether the techologies required are used
- code structure
- programming best practices
- legibility
- styling and appearance
- responsiveness
- rendering performance

## How to get the data from Github 
### Search Repos
To get the most starred Github repos created in the last 30 days (relative to 2017-11-22), you'll need to call the following endpoint : 

`https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:>2017-10-22&sort=stars&order=desc`

The JSON data from Github will be paginated (you'll receive around 100 repos per JSON page). 

To get the 2nd page, you add `&page=2` to the end of your API request : 

`https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:>2017-10-22&sort=stars&order=desc&page=2`

To get the 3rd page, you add `&page=3` ... etc

You can read more about the Github API over [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories
).

### Commit/Additions/Deletions Activity
You will need the following to get the total weekly additions/deletions activity

`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/code_frequency` [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/metrics#get-the-weekly-commit-activity)

ex: `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/stats/code_frequency`

You will need the following to get the total weekly commits activity

`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/commit_activity` [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/metrics#get-the-last-year-of-commit-activity)

ex: `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/stats/commit_activity`

You will need the folowing to get the weekly additions/deletions/commits activity per contributor

`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/contributors` [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/metrics#get-all-contributor-commit-activity)

ex: `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/stats/contributors`

## Technologies to use 
We'd like to see your implementation using the following technologies:
* React (hooks)
* Redux (redux-toolkit.js)
* Redux Saga
* MUI

It is preferred that you use
* Highcharts

## How to submit the challenge solution? 
After you finished your app, please follow the instructions below:

1. Create or use an existing account on `https://codesandbox.io` so you can save and share your work
2. Create a sandbox
3. Email including
- time spent
- link to the code sandbox with all necessary dependencies and full implementation
